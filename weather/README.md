## Analysis

Data cleaning (date parsing, missing-value imputation) and exploratory analysis were performed in Jupyter notebook file included in the code folder. Graphs were generated in order: mean daily precipitation → monthly boxplots → t-test bar plots → z-test proportions bar plot → seasonal proportions → annual means and total line graph. Running the notebook top-to-bottom recreates all results.

## Results

Charlotte shows higher precipiation especially in summer, while Seattle shows higher precipitation especially in winter.
